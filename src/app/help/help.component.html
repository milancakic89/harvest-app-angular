        <p>The main purpose of this application is to track data for farmed goods by printing barcodes and attaching
          them to boxes that will be used
          for farming. Since more than one person can farm, barcodes are printed with some additional information.
          Those information are usefull once the barcode is scanned at measurement point. They provide following
          information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employee that box belongs to.</li>
          <li>Sector where it was farmed.</li>
          <li>Variety that is inside the box</li>
          <li>Date of printing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, In order to print first barcode, you must have at least one of each:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employee</li>
          <li>Variety</li>
          <li>Both can be created by clicking <a routerLink="/add">HERE</a></li>
          <li>Sector is required also, but it can be provided from <a routerLink="/harvest">HARVEST</a> directly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With those information box is ready to be farmed to. Once farmed, box then goes for measurement.
          Measurement is done by scanning the barcode, and measuring the weight of the box.
          In order to measure, you must have the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Measurement account, can be created by clicking <a routerLink="/add">HERE</a></li>
          <li>Person to do the measurement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to measure, you must login with measurement account details that you have previously created</p>
        <p>Measurement account leads you to second part of this application, currently not available.</p>
        <p>This second part of application is focused on measurement only. It provides the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All boxes generated in HARVEST</li>
          <li>Filtering boxes</li>
          <li>Scanning boxes barcodes</li>
          <li>Entering the weight amount</li>
          <li>Switching boxes to different employee if needed</li>
        </ul>
