## Harvest App
Created from Harvest App repository
Application is separated into two parts to reduce complexity.

### Major purpose of the application is to track:
*Where employees are farming (sector)
*Which variety are they farming
*How mush did they farm in total

### Proccess: FIRST PART
Print barcodes with metadata (sector, employee, variety), and attach them to some boxes or whatever they are farming to. Once "boxes" are farmed, scan barcodes (SECOND PART OF THE APPLICATION), and enter the weight. Person who scans the barcodes don't need to track which employee farmed them, because barcodes are holding those informations.

## FIRST PART FEATURES
### Adding:
*employees *variety *supervizors

Logging with supervizor account allows you to use second part of aplication
